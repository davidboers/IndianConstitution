    <p class="cl">When a Bill has been passed by the Legislative Assembly of a State or, in the case of a State having a Legislative 
        Council, has been passed by both Houses of the Legislature of the State, it shall be presented to the Governor and the Governor 
        shall declare either that he assents to the Bill or that he withholds assent therefrom or that he reserves the Bill for the 
        consideration of the President:</p>
    <p class="cl">Provided that the Governor may, as soon as possible after the presentation to him of the Bill for assent, return the Bill 
        if it is not a Money Bill together with a message requesting that the House or Houses will reconsider the Bill or any specified 
        provisions thereof and, in particular, will consider the desirability of introducing any such amendments as he may recommend in his
        message and, when a Bill is so returned, the House or Houses shall reconsider the Bill accordingly, and if the Bill is passed again 
        by the House or Houses with or without amendment and presented to the Governor for assent, the Governor shall not withhold assent 
        therefrom:</p>
    <p class="cl">Provided further that the Governor shall not assent to, but shall reserve for the consideration of the President, any 
        Bill which in the opinion of the Governor would, if it became law, so derogate from the powers of the High Court as to endanger the 
        position which that Court is by this Constitution designed to fill.</p>
