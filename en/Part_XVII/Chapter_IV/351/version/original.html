    <p class="cl">It shall be the duty of the Union to promote the spread of the Hindi language, to develop it so that it may serve as a 
        medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India and to secure its enrichment by assimilating without 
        interfering with its genius, the forms, style and expressions used in Hindustani and in the other languages of India specified in 
        the Eighth Schedule, and by drawing, wherever necessary or desirable, for its vocabulary, primarily on Sanskrit and secondarily on 
        other languages.</p>
