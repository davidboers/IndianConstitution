    <p class="cl">(1) An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment, decree or final order in a civil proceeding of a High 
        Court in the territory of India if the High Court certifies—</p>
        <p class="scl">(a) <span class="del changes">that the amount or value of the subject-matter of the dispute in the court of first 
            instance and still in dispute on appeal was and is not less than twenty thousand rupees or such other sum as may be specified 
            in that behalf by Parliament by law; or</span> <span class="ins changes">that the case involves a substantial question of law 
            of general importance; and</span></p>
        <p class="scl">(b) <span class="del changes">that the judgement, decree or final order involves directly or indirectly some claim 
            or question respecting property of the like amount or value; or</span> <span class="ins changes">that in the opinion of the 
            High Court the said question needs to be decided by the Supreme Court.</span></p>
        <p class="scl"><span class="del changes">(c) that the case is a fit one for approval to the Supreme Court;</span></p>
    <p>and, where the judgement, decree or final order appealed from affirms the decision of the court immediately below in any case other 
        than a case referred to in sub-clause (c), if the High Court further certifies that the appeal involves some substantial question 
        of law.</p>
    <p class="cl">(2) Notwithstanding anything in article 132, any party appealing to the Supreme Court under clause (1) may urge as one of

    <p class="cl">(3) Notwithstanding anything in this article, no appeal shall, unless Parliament by law otherwise provides, lie to the 
        Supreme Court from the judgement, decree or final order of one Judge of a High Court.</p>
