    <p class="cl">(1) Notwithstanding anything in article 32, every High Court shall have power, throughout the territories in relation to 
        which it exercises jurisdiction, to issue to any person or authority, including in appropriate cases, any Government, within those 
        territories directions, orders or writs, including writs in the nature of <i>habeas corpus</i>, <i>mandamus</i>, prohibition, 
        <i>quo warranto</i> and <i>certiorari</i>, or any of them,<span class="del changes">— (a)</span> for the enforcement of any of the 
        rights conferred by Part III<span class="del changes">; or (b) for the redress of any injury of a substantial nature by reason of 
        the contravention of any other provision of this Constitution or any provision of any enactment or Ordinance or any order, rule, 
        regulation, bye-law or other instrument made thereunder; or (c) for the redress of any injury by reason of any illegality in any 
        proceedings by or before any authority under any provision referred to in sub-clause (b) where such illegality has resulted in 
        substantial failure of justice.</span> <span class="ins changes">and for any other purpose.</span></p>
    <p class="cl">(2) The power conferred by clause (1) to issue directions, orders or writs to any Government, authority or person may 
        also be exercised by any High Court exercising jurisdiction in relation to the territories within which the cause of action, wholly 
        or in part, arises for the exercise of such power, notwithstanding that the seat of such Government or authority or the residence 
        of such person is not within those territories.</p>
    <p class="cl"><span class="del changes">(3) No petition for the redress of any injury referred to in sub-clause (b) or sub-clause (c) 
        of clause (1) shall be entertained if any other remedy for such redress is provided for by or under any other law for the time 
        being in force.</span></p>
    <p class="cl"><span class="del changes">(4) No interim order (whether by way of injunction or stay or in any other manner) shall be 
        made on, or in any proceedings relating to, a petition under clause (1) unless—</span></p>
        <p class="scl"><span class="del changes">(a) copies of such petition and of all documents in support of the plea for such interim 
            order are furnished to the party against whom such petition is filed or proposed to be filed; and</span></p>
        <p class="scl"><span class="del changes">(b) opportunity is given to such party to be heard in the matter.</span></p>
    <p class="cl"><span class="del changes">(5) The High Court may dispense with the requirements of sub-clauses (a) and (b) of clause (4) 
        and make an interim order as an exceptional measure if it is satisfied for reasons to be record in writing that it is necessary so 
        to do for preventing any loss being caused to the petitioner which cannot be adequately compensated in money but any such interim 
        order shall, if it is not vacated earlier, cease to have effect on the expiry of a period of fourteen days from the date on which 
        it is made unless the said requirements have been complied with before the expiry of that period and the High Court has continued 
        the operation of the interim order.</span></p>
    <p class="cl"><span class="del changes">(6) Notwithstanding anything in clause (4) or clause (5), no interim order (whether by way of 
        injunction or stay or in any other manner) shall be made on, or in any proceedings relating to, a petition under clause (1) where 
        such order will have the effect of delaying any inquiry into a matter of public importance or any investigation or inquiry into an 
        offence punishable with imprisonment or any action for the execution of any work or project of public utility, or the acquisition 
        of any property for such execution, by the Government or any corporation owned or controlled by the Government.</span></p>
    <p class="cl"><span class="ins changes">(3) Where any party against whom an interim order, whether by way of injunction or stay or in 
        any other manner, is made on, or in any proceedings relating to, a petition under clause (1), without—</span></p>
        <p class="scl"><span class="ins changes">(a) furnishing to such party copies of such petition and all documents in support of the 
            plea for such interim order; and</span></p>

        application to the party in whose favour such order has been made or the counsel of such party, the High Court shall dispose of the 
        application within a period of two weeks from the date on which it is received or from the date on which the copy of such 
        application is so furnished, whichever is later, or where the High Court is closed on the last day of that period, before the
        expiry of the next day afterwards on which the High Court is open; and if the application is not so disposed of, the interim order 
        shall, on the expiry of that period, or, as the case may be, the expiry of the said next day, stand vacated.</span></p>
