    <p class="cl">(1) If the President, on receipt of a report from the Governor of a State or otherwise, is satisfied that a situation has 
        arisen in which the Government of the State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of this Constitution, the 
        President may by Proclamation—</p>
        <p class="scl">(a) assume to himself all or any of the functions of the Government of the State and all or any of the powers vested 
            in or exercisable by the Governor or any body or authority in the State other than the Legislature of the State;</p>
        <p class="scl">(b) declare that the powers of the Legislature of the State shall be exercisable by or under the authority of 
            Parliament;</p>
        <p class="scl">(c) make such incidental and consequential provisions as appear to the President to be necessary or desirable for 
            giving effect to the objects of the Proclamation, including provisions for suspending in whole or in part the operation of any 
            provisions of this Constitution relating to any body or authority in the State:</p>
    <p class="cl">Provided that nothing in this clause shall authorise the President to assume to himself any of the powers vested in or 
        exercisable by a High Court, or to suspend in whole or in part the operation of any provision of this Constitution relating to High 
        Courts.</p>
    <p class="cl">(2) Any such Proclamation may be revoked or varied by a subsequent Proclamation.</p>
    <p class="cl">(3) Every Proclamation under this article shall be laid before each House of Parliament and shall, except where it is a 
        Proclamation revoking a previous Proclamation, cease to operate at the expiration of two months unless before the expiration of 
        that period it has been approved by resolutions of both Houses of Parliament:</p>
    <p class="cl">Provided that if any such Proclamation (not being a Proclamation revoking a previous Proclamation) is issued at a time 
        when the House of the People is dissolved or the dissolution of the House of the People takes place during the period of two months 
        referred to in this clause, and if a resolution approving the Proclamation has been passed by the Council of States, but no 
        resolution with respect to such Proclamation has been passed by the House of the People before the expiration of that period, the 
        Proclamation shall cease to operate at the expiration of thirty days from the date on which the House of the People first sits 
        after its reconstitution unless before the expiration of the said period of thirty days a resolution approving the Proclamation has 
        been also passed by the House of the People.</p>
    <p class="cl">(4) A Proclamation so approved shall, unless revoked, cease to operate on the expiration of a period of 
        <span class="del">six months</span> <span class="ins">one year</span> from the date of the passing of the second of the resolutions 
        approving the Proclamation under clause (3):</p>
    <p class="cl">Provided that if and so often as a resolution approving the continuance in force of such a Proclamation is passed by both 
        Houses of Parliament, the Proclamation shall, unless revoked, continue in force for a further period of <span class="del">six 
        months</span> <span class="ins">one year</span> from the date on which under this clause it would otherwise have ceased to operate, 
        but no such Proclamation shall in any case remain in force for more than three years:</p>
    <p class="cl">Provided further that if the dissolution of the House of the People takes place during any such period of 
        <span class="del">six months</span> <span class="ins">one year</span> and a resolution approving the continuance in force of such 
        Proclamation has been passed by the Council of States, but no resolution with respect to the continuance in force of such 
        Proclamation has been passed by the House of the People during the said period, the Proclamation shall cease to operate at the 
        expiration of thirty days from the date on which the House of the People first sits after its reconstitution unless before the 
        expiration of the said period of thirty days a resolution approving the continuance in force of the Proclamation has been also 
        passed by the House of the People.</p>
    <p class="cl">(5) Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the satisfaction of the President mentioned in clause (1) shall be 
        final and conclusive and shall not be questioned in any court on any ground.</p>
