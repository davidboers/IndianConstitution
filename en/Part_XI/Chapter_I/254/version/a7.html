    <p class="cl">(1) If any provision of a law made by the Legislature of a State is repugnant to any provision of a law made by 
        Parliament which Parliament is competent to enact, or to any provision of an existing law with respect to one of the matters 
        enumerated in the Concurrent List, then, subject to the provisions of clause (2), the law made by Parliament, whether passed before 
        or after the law made by the Legislature of such State, or, as the case may be, the existing law, shall prevail and the law made by 
        the Legislature of the State shall, to the extent of the repugnancy, be void.</p>
    <p class="cl">(2) Where a law made by the Legislature of a State <span class="del changes">specified in Part A or Part B of the First 
        Schedule</span> with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List contains any provision repugnant to the 
        provisions of an earlier law made by Parliament or an existing law with respect to that matter, then, the law so made by the 
        Legislature of such State shall, if it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent, 
        prevail in that State:</p>
    <p class="cl">Provided that nothing in this clause shall prevent Parliament from enacting at any time any law with respect to the same 
        matter including a law adding to, amending, varying or repealing the law so made by the Legislature of the State.</p>
