    <p class="cl">Provided that, where the Bill is not a Money Bill, the President may direct the Governor to return the Bill to the House 
        or, as the case may be, the Houses of the Legislature of the State together with such a message as is mentioned in the first 
        proviso to article 200 and, when a Bill is so returned, the House or Houses shall reconsider it accordingly within a period of six 
        months from the date of receipt of such message and, if it is again passed by the House or Houses with or without amendment, it 
        shall be presented again to the President for his consideration.</p>
