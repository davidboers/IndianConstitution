    <p class="cl">(1) An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgment, decree or final order in a civil proceeding of a High 
        Court in the territory of India if the High Court certifies—</p>
        <p class="scl">(a) that the amount or value of the subject-matter of the dispute in the court of first instance and still in 
            dispute on appeal was and is not less than twenty thousand rupees or such other sum as may be specified in that behalf by 
            Parliament by law; or</p>
        <p class="scl">(b) that the judgement, decree or final order involves directly or indirectly some claim or question respecting 
            property of the like amount or value; or</p>
        <p class="scl">(c) that the case is a fit one for approval to the Supreme Court;</p>
    <p>and, where the judgement, decree or final order appealed from affirms the decision of the court immediately below in any case other 
        than a case referred to in sub-clause (c), if the High Court further certifies that the appeal involves some substantial question 
        of law.</p>
    <p class="cl">(2) Notwithstanding anything in article 132, any party appealing to the Supreme Court under clause (1) may urge as one of

        decided.</p>
    <p class="cl">(3) Notwithstanding anything in this article, no appeal shall, unless Parliament by law otherwise provides, lie to the
