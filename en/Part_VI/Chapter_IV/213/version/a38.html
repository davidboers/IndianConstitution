    <p class="art">213. Power of Governor to promulgate Ordinances during recess of Legislature.—</p>
    <div id="effective-date">Effective 26/1/1950 (retrospective; <span id="eff-day">1</span>/<span id="eff-month">8</span>/<span id="eff-year">1975</span>)</div>
    
    <p class="cl">(1) If at any time, except when the Legislative Assembly of a State is in session, or where there is a Legislative 
        Council in a State, except when both Houses of the Legislature are in session, the Governor is satisfied that circumstances exist 
        which render it necessary for him to take immediate action, he may promulgate such Ordinances as the circumstances appear to him to 
        require:</p>
    <p class="cl">Provided that the Governor shall not, without instructions from the President, promulgate any such Ordinance if—</p>
        <p class="scl">(a) a Bill containing the same provisions would under this Constitution have required the previous sanction of the 
            President for the introduction thereof into the Legislature; or</p>
        <p class="scl">(b) he would have deemed it necessary to reserve a Bill containing the same provisions for the consideration of the 
            President; or</p>
        <p class="scl">(c) an Act of the Legislature of the State containing the same provisions would under this Constitution have been 
            invalid unless, having been reserved for the consideration of the President, it had received the assent of the President.</p>
    <p class="cl">(2) An Ordinance promulgated under this article shall have the same force and effect as an Act of the Legislature of the
        State assented to by the Governor, but every such Ordinance—</p>
        <p class="scl">(a) shall be laid before the Legislative Assembly of the State, or where there is a Legislative Council in the 
            State, before both the Houses, and shall cease to operate at the expiration of six weeks from the reassembly of the 
            Legislature, or if before the expiration of that period a resolution disapproving it is passed by the Legislative Assembly and
            agreed to by the Legislative Council, if any, upon the passing of the resolution or, as the case may be, on the resolution 
            being agreed to by the Council; and</p>
        <p class="scl">(b) may be withdrawn at any time by the Governor.</p>
    <p class="ex"><span class="ex-hd">Explanation.</span>— Where the Houses of the Legislature of a State having a Legislative Council are 
        summoned to assemble on different dates, the period of six weeks shall be reckoned from the later of those dates for the purposes 
        of this clause.</p>
    <p class="cl">(3) If and so far as an Ordinance under this article makes any provision which would not be valid if enacted in an Act of 
        the Legislature of the State assented to by the Governor, it shall be void:</p>
    <p class="cl">Provided that, for the purposes of the provisions of this Constitution relating to the effect of an Act of the 
        Legislature of a State which is repugnant to an Act of Parliament or an existing law with respect to a matter enumerated in the 
        Concurrent List, an Ordinance promulgated under this article in pursuance of instructions from the President shall be deemed to be 
        an Act of the Legislature of the State which has been reserved for the consideration of the President and assented to by him.</p>
    <p class="cl"><span class="ins changes">(4) Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the satisfaction of the Governor mentioned 
        in clause (1) shall be final and conclusive and shall not be questioned in any court on any ground.</span></p>
