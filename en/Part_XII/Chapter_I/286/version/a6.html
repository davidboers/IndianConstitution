    <p class="cl"><span class="del">Provided that the President may by order direct that any tax on the sale or purchase of goods which was

    <p class="cl"><span class="del">(3) No law made by the Legislature of a State imposing, or authorising the imposition of, a tax on the 
        sale or purchase of any such goods as have been declared by Parliament by law to be essential for the life of the community shall 
        have effect unless it has been reserved for the consideration of the President and has received his assent.</span></p>
    <p class="cl"><span class="ins">(2) Parliament may by law formulate principles for determining when a sale or purchase of goods takes 
        place in any of the ways mentioned in clause (1).</span></p>
    <p class="cl"><span class="ins">(3) Any law of a State shall, in so far as it imposes or authorises the imposition of, a tax on the 
        sale or purchase of goods declared by Parliament by law to be of special importance in inter-State trade or commerce, be subject to such
        restrictions and conditions in regard to the system of levy, rates and other incidents of the tax as Parliament may by law 
        specify.</span></p>
