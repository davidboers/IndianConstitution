    <p class="cl">(1) Notwithstanding anything in article 32<span class="del changes"> but subject to the provisions of article 131A and 
        article 226A</span>, every High Court shall have power, throughout the territories in relation to which it exercises jurisdiction, 
        to issue to any person or authority, including in appropriate cases, any Government, within those territories directions, orders or 
        writs, including writs in the nature of <i>habeas corpus</i>, <i>mandamus</i>, prohibition, <i>quo warranto</i> and 
        <i>certiorari</i>, or any of them,—</p>
        <p class="cl">(a) for the enforcement of any of the rights conferred by Part III; or</p>
        <p class="cl">(b) for the redress of any injury of a substantial nature by reason of the contravention of any other provision of 
            this Constitution or any provision of any enactment or Ordinance or any order, rule, regulation, bye-law or other instrument 
            made thereunder; or</p>
        <p class="cl">(c) for the redress of any injury by reason of any illegality in any proceedings by or before any authority under any 
            provision referred to in sub-clause (b) where such illegality has resulted in substantial failure of justice.</p>
    <p class="cl">(2) The power conferred by clause (1) to issue directions, orders or writs to any Government, authority or person may 
        also be exercised by any High Court exercising jurisdiction in relation to the territories within which the cause of action, wholly 
        or in part, arises for the exercise of such power, notwithstanding that the seat of such Government or authority or the residence 
        of such person is not within those territories.</p>
    <p class="cl">(3) No petition for the redress of any injury referred to in sub-clause (b) or sub-clause (c) of clause (1) shall be 
        entertained if any other remedy for such redress is provided for by or under any other law for the time being in force.</p>
    <p class="cl">(4) No interim order (whether by way of injunction or stay or in any other manner) shall be made on, or in any 
        proceedings relating to, a petition under clause (1) unless—</p>
        <p class="scl">(a) copies of such petition and of all documents in support of the plea for such interim order are furnished to the 
            party against whom such petition is filed or proposed to be filed; and</p>
        <p class="scl">(b) opportunity is given to such party to be heard in the matter.</p>
    <p class="cl">(5) The High Court may dispense with the requirements of sub-clauses (a) and (b) of clause (4) and make an interim order 
        as an exceptional measure if it is satisfied for reasons to be record in writing that it is necessary so to do for preventing any 
        loss being caused to the petitioner which cannot be adequately compensated in money but any such interim order shall, if it is not 
        vacated earlier, cease to have effect on the expiry of a period of fourteen days from the date on which it is made unless the said 
        requirements have been complied with before the expiry of that period and the High Court has continued the operation of the interim 
        order.</p>
    <p class="cl">(6) Notwithstanding anything in clause (4) or clause (5), no interim order (whether by way of injunction or stay or in 
        any other manner) shall be made on, or in any proceedings relating to, a petition under clause (1) where such order will have the 
        effect of delaying any inquiry into a matter of public importance or any investigation or inquiry into an offence punishable with 
        imprisonment or any action for the execution of any work or project of public utility, or the acquisition of any property for such 
        execution, by the Government or any corporation owned or controlled by the Government.</p>
    <p class="cl">(7) The power conferred on a High Court by this article shall not be in derogation of the power conferred on the Supreme 
        Court by clause (2) of article 32.</p>
