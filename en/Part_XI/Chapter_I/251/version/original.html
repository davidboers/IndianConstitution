    <p class="cl">Nothing in articles 249 and 250 shall restrict the power of the Legislature of a State to make any law which under this 
        Constitution it has power to make, but if any provision of a law made by the Legislature of a State is repugnant to any provision 
        of a law made by Parliament which Parliament has under either of the said articles power to make, the law made by Parliament, 
        whether passed before or after the law made by the Legislature of the State, shall prevail, and the law made by the Legislature of 
        the State shall to the extent of the repugnancy, but so long only as the law made by Parliament continues to have effect, be 
        inoperative.</p>
