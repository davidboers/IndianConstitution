    <div id="effective-date">Effective <span id="eff-day">26</span>/<span id="eff-month">1</span>/<span id="eff-year">1950</span></div>
    
    <p class="cl">(1) If after a Bill has been passed by one House and transmitted to the other House—</p>
        <p class="scl">(a) the Bill is rejected by the other House; or</p>
        <p class="scl">(b) the Houses have finally disagreed as to the amendments to be made in the Bill; or</p>
        <p class="scl">(c) more than six months elapse from the date of the reception of the Bill by the other House without the Bill being 
            passed by it,</p>
    <p>the President may, unless the Bill has elapsed by reason of a dissolution of the House of the People, notify to the Houses by 
        message if they are sitting or by public notification if they are not sitting, his intention to summon them to meet in a joint 
        sitting for the purpose of deliberating and voting on the Bill:</p>
    <p class="cl">Provided that nothing in this clause shall apply to a Money Bill.</p>
    <p class="cl">(2) In reckoning any such period of six months as is referred to in clause (1), no account shall be taken of any period 
        during which the House referred to in sub-clause (c) of that clause is prorogued or adjourned for more than four consecutive days.</p>
    <p class="cl">(3) Where the President has under clause (1) notified his intention of summoning the Houses to meet in a joint sitting, 
        neither House shall proceed further with the Bill, but the President may at any time after the date of his notification summon the 
        Houses to meet in a joint sitting for the purpose specified in the notification and, if he does so, the Houses shall meet 
        accordingly.</p>
    <p class="cl">(4) If at the joint sitting of the two Houses the Bill, with such amendments, if any, as are agreed to in joint sitting, 
        is passed by a majority of the total number of members of both Houses present and voting, it shall be deemed for the purposes of 
        this Constitution to have been passed by both Houses:</p>
    <p class="cl">Provided that at a joint sitting—</p>
        <p class="scl">(a) if the Bill, having been passed by one House, has not been passed by the other House with amendments and 
            returned to the House in which it originated, no amendment shall be proposed to the Bill other than such amendments (if any) as 
            are made necessary by the delay in the passage of the Bill;</p>
        <p class="scl">(b) if the Bill has been so passed and returned, only such amendments as aforesaid shall be proposed to the Bill and 
            such other amendments as are relevant to the matters with respect to which the Houses have not agreed,</p>
    <p>and the decision of the person presiding as to the amendments which are admissible under this clause shall be final.</p>
    <p class="cl">(5) A joint sitting may be held under this article and a Bill passed thereat, notwithstanding that a dissolution of the 
        House of the People has intervened since the President notified his intention to summon the Houses to meet therein.</p>
