    <p class="cl">(1) As far as practicable, there shall be uniformity in the scale of representation of the different States at the 
        election of the President.</p>
    <p class="cl">(2) For the purpose of securing such uniformity among the States <i>inter se</i> as well as parity between the States as 
        a whole and the Union, the number of votes which each elected member of Parliament and of the Legislative Assembly of each State is 
        entitled to cast at such election shall be determined in the following manner:—</p>
        <p class="scl">(a) every elected member of the Legislative Assembly of a State shall have as many votes as there are multiples of 
            one thousand in the quotient obtained by dividing the population of the State by the total number of the elected members of the 
            Assembly;</p>
        <p class="scl">(b) if, after taking the said multiples of one thousand, the remainder is not less than five hundred, then the vote 
            of each member referred to in sub-clause (a) shall be further increased by one;</p>
        <p class="scl">(c) each elected member of either House of Parliament shall have such number of votes as may be obtained by dividing 
            the total number of votes assigned to the members of the Legislative Assemblies of the States under sub-clauses (a) and (b) by 
            the total number of the elected members of both Houses of Parliament, fractions exceeding one-half being counted as one and 
            other fractions being disregarded.</p>
    <p class="cl">(3) The election of the President shall be held in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of 
        the single transferable vote and the voting at such election shall be by secret ballot.</p>
