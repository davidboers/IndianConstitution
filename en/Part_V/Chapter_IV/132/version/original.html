    <p class="cl">(1) An appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court from any judgement, decree or final order of a High Court in the territory 
        of India, whether in a civil, criminal or other proceeding, if the High Court certifies that the case involves a substantial 
        question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution.</p>
    <p class="cl">(2) Where the High Court has refused to give such a certificate, the Supreme Court may, if it is satisfied that the case 
        involves a substantial question of law as to the interpretation of this Constitution, grant special leave to appeal from such 
        judgement, decree or final order.</p>
    <p class="cl">(3) Where such a certificate is given, or such leave is granted, any party in the case may appeal to the Supreme Court on
        the ground that any such question as aforesaid has been wrongly decided and, with the leave of the Supreme Court, on any other 
        ground.</p>
    <p class="ex"><i>Explanation.</i>—For the purposes of this article, the expression "final order" includes an order deciding an issue 
        which, if decided in favour of the appellant, would be sufficient for the final disposal of the case.</p>
