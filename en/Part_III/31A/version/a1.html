    <p class="cl">(1) Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing provisions of this Part, no law providing for the acquisition by the State 
        of any estate or of any rights therein or for the extinguishment or modification of any such rights shall be deemed to be void on 
        the ground that it is inconsistent with, or takes away or abridges any of the rights conferred by, any provisions of this Part:</p>
    <p class="cl">Provided that where such law is a law made by the Legislature of a State, the provisions of this article shall not apply 
        thereto unless such law, having been reserved for the consideration of the President, has received his assent.</p>
    <p class="cl">(2) In this article,—</p>
        <p class="scl">(a) the expression "estate" shall, in relation to any local area, have the same meaning as that expression or its 
            local equivalent has in the existing law relating to land tenures in force in that area, and shall also include any 
            <span style="font-style: italic;">jagir</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">inam</span> or
            <span style="font-style: italic;">muafi</span> or other similar grant;</p>
        <p class="scl">(b) the expression "rights", in relation to an estate, shall include any rights vesting in a proprietor, 
            sub-proprietor, under-proprietor, tenure-holder or other intermediary and any rights or privileges in respect of land revenue.</p>
