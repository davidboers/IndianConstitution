    <p class="cl">(1) If it appears to the Legislatures of two or more States to be desirable that any of the matters with respect to which 
        Parliament has no power to make laws for the States except as provided in articles 249 and 250 should be regulated in such States 
        by Parliament by law, and if resolutions to that effect are passed by all the Houses of the Legislatures of those States, it shall 
        be lawful for Parliament to pass an act for regulating that matter accordingly, and any Act so passed shall apply to such States 
        and to any other State by which it is adopted afterwards by resolution passed in that behalf by the House or, where there are two 
        Houses, by each of the Houses of the Legislature of that State.</p>
    <p class="cl">(2) Any Act so passed by Parliament may be amended or repealed by an Act of Parliament passed or adopted in like manner 
        but shall not, as respects any State to which it applies, be amended or repealed by an Act of the Legislature of that State.</p>
