        <p class="scl">(a) consumed by the Government of India, or sold to the Government of India for consumption by that Government; 
            or</p>
        <p class="scl">(b) consumed in the construction, maintenance or operation of any railway by the Government of India or a railway 
            company operating that railway, or sold to that Government or any such railway company for consumption in the construction, 
            maintenance or operation of any railway,</p>
    <p>and any such law imposing, or authorising the imposition of, a tax on the sale of electricity shall secure that the price of 
        electricity sold to the Government of India for consumption by that Government, or to any such railway company as aforesaid for 
        consumption in the construction, maintenance or operation of any railway, shall be less by the amount of the tax than the price 
        charged to other consumers of a substantial quantity of electricity.</p>
