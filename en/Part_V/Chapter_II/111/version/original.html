    <p class="cl">Provided that the President may, as soon as possible after the presentation to him of a Bill for assent, return the Bill 
        if it is not a Money Bill to the Houses with a message requesting that they will reconsider the Bill or any specified provisions 
        thereof and, in particular, will consider the desirability of introducing any such amendments as he may recommend in his message,
        and when a Bill is so returned, the Houses shall reconsider the Bill accordingly, and if the Bill is passed again by the Houses
