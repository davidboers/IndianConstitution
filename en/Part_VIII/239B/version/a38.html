    <p class="cl">(1) If at any time, except when the Legislature of a Union territory referred to in clause (1) of article 239A is in 
        session, the administrator thereof is satisfied that circumstances exist which render it necessary for him to take immediate 
        action, he may promulgate such Ordinances as the circumstances appear to him to require:</p>
    <p class="cl">Provided that no such Ordinance shall be promulgated by the administrator except after obtaining instructions from the 
        President in that behalf:</p>
    <p class="cl">Provided further that whenever the said Legislature is dissolved, or its functioning remains suspended on account of any 
        action taken under any such law as is referred to in clause (1) of article 239A, the administrator shall not promulgate any 
        Ordinance during the period of such dissolution or suspension.</p>
    <p class="cl">(2) An Ordinance promulgated under this article in pursuance of instructions from the President shall be deemed to be an 
        Act of the Legislature of the Union territory which has been duly enacted after complying with the provisions in that behalf 
        contained in any such law as is referred to in clause (1) of article 239A, but every such Ordinance—</p>
        <p class="scl">(a) shall be laid before the Legislature of the Union territory and shall cease to operate at the expiration of six 
            weeks from the reassembly of the Legislature or if, before the expiration of that period, a resolution disapproving it is 
            passed by the Legislature, upon the passing of the resolution; and</p>
        <p class="scl">(b) may be withdrawn at any time by the administrator after obtaining instructions from the President in that 
            behalf.</p>
    <p class="cl">(3) If and so far as an Ordinance under this article makes any provision which would not be valid if enacted in an Act of 
        the Legislature of the Union territory made after complying with the provisions in that behalf contained in any such law as is 
        referred to in clause (1) of article 239A, it shall be void.</p>
    <p class="cl"><span class="ins">(4) Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution, the satisfaction of the administrator mentioned in 
        clause (1) shall be final and conclusive and shall not be questioned in any court on any ground.</span></p>
