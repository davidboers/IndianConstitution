    <p class="cl">(1) During the first two years after the commencement of this Constitution, appointments of members of the Anglo-Indian

    <p class="cl">(2) Nothing in clause (1) shall bar the appointment of members of the Anglo-Indian community to posts other than, or in 
        addition to, those reserved for the community under that clause if such members are found qualified for appointment on merit as 
        compared with the members of other communities.</p>
